## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

A minimum valuable product is a functional product (or solution) with just enough features to satisfy customer's requirements at initial adoption, but leaves room for feedback for future product/solution development.

- Avoid building a solution this way where you only discover if there is success at the end.
- Instead, start with something basic and gather feedback as you get more complex.
