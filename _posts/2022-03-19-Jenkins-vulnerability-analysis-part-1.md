The goal here is to learn/find out what kind of vulnerabilities can be found in Jenkins.

To achieve this, I based all my research on their [*Security Advisory*](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisories/).

I went through all of the web pages from **January 2021** to **March 2022**. On each page, I ran this piece of JavaScript to fastly get all the vulnerabilities name.

```js
var x =  document.querySelectorAll("h3");
for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
	console.log(x[i].innerText);
}
```

Which gave me those results. (Boring like this I know)
